## IU internationale Hochschule

I am using the juice store as a reference base application. in my bachelor research thesis i want to check the impact of DevSecOps on the agility of DevOps. for this purpose two CI/CD pipelines are built and compared with each other. 
- a DevOps pipeline with test, build and deployment.
- a DevSecOps pipeline with SAST and DAST components.

The pipelines will be configure with Github Actions and Azure

## What is Juice Shop ?

OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in security
trainings, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the
entire
[OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten) along with many other security flaws found in real-world
applications!

## Setup

> You can find some less common installation variations in
> [the _Running OWASP Juice Shop_ documentation](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/part1/running.html).

### From Sources

![GitHub repo size](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/juice-shop/juice-shop.svg)

1. Install [node.js](#nodejs-version-compatibility)
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop.git --depth 1` (or
   clone [your own fork](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/fork)
   of the repository)
3. Go into the cloned folder with `cd juice-shop`
4. Run `npm install` (only has to be done before first start or when you change the source code)
5. Run `npm start`
6. Browse to <http://localhost:3000>

### Packaged Distributions

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/juice-shop/juice-shop/total.svg)](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/releases/latest)
[![SourceForge](https://img.shields.io/sourceforge/dm/juice-shop?label=sourceforge%20downloads)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/juice-shop/)
[![SourceForge](https://img.shields.io/sourceforge/dt/juice-shop?label=sourceforge%20downloads)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/juice-shop/)

1. Install a 64bit [node.js](#nodejs-version-compatibility) on your Windows, MacOS or Linux machine
2. Download `juice-shop-<version>_<node-version>_<os>_x64.zip` (or
   `.tgz`) attached to
   [latest release](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/releases/latest)
3. Unpack and `cd` into the unpacked folder
4. Run `npm start`
5. Browse to <http://localhost:3000>

> Each packaged distribution includes some binaries for `sqlite3` and
> `libxmljs` bound to the OS and node.js version which `npm install` was
> executed on.

### Docker Container

[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/bkimminich/juice-shop.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/bkimminich/juice-shop)
![Docker Stars](https://img.shields.io/docker/stars/bkimminich/juice-shop.svg)

[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/version/bkimminich/juice-shop.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/bkimminich/juice-shop
"Get your own version badge on microbadger.com")

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
2. Run `docker pull bkimminich/juice-shop`
3. Run `docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop`
4. Browse to <http://localhost:3000> (on macOS and Windows browse to
   <http://192.168.99.100:3000> if you are using docker-machine instead of the native docker installation)


### Azure Container Instance

1. Open and login (via `az login`) to your
   [Azure CLI](https://azure.github.io/projects/clis/) **or** login to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com),
   open the _CloudShell_
   and then choose _Bash_ (not PowerShell).
2. Create a resource group by running `az group create --name <group name> --location <location name, e.g. "centralus">`
3. Create a new container by
   running `az container create --resource-group <group name> --name <container name> --image bkimminich/juice-shop --dns-name-label <dns name label> --ports 3000 --ip-address public`
4. Your container will be available at `http://<dns name label>.<location name>.azurecontainer.io:3000`

### Google Compute Engine Instance

1. Login to the Google Cloud Console and
   [open Cloud Shell](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?cloudshell=true).
2. Launch a new GCE instance based on the juice-shop container. Take note of the `EXTERNAL_IP` provided in the output.

```
gcloud compute instances create-with-container owasp-juice-shop-app --container-image bkimminich/juice-shop
```

3. Create a firewall rule that allows inbound traffic to port 3000

```
gcloud compute firewall-rules create juice-rule --allow tcp:3000
```

4. Your container is now running and available at
   `http://<EXTERNAL_IP>:3000/`

> This is a deployment-test and sneak-peek instance only! You are __not
> supposed__ to use this instance for your own hacking endeavours! No
> guaranteed uptime! Guaranteed stern looks if you break it!

Juice Shop is automatically tested _only on the latest `.x` minor version_ of each node.js version mentioned above!
There is no guarantee that older minor node.js releases will always work with Juice Shop!
Please make sure you stay up to date with your chosen version.
