## IU internationale Hochschule

I am using the juice store as a reference base application. in my bachelor research thesis i want to check the impact of DevSecOps on the agility of DevOps. for this purpose two CI/CD pipelines are built and compared with each other. 
- a DevOps pipeline with test, build and deployment.
- a DevSecOps pipeline with SAST and DAST components.

The pipelines will be configure with Github Actions and Azure

## What is Juice Shop ?

OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in security
trainings, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the
entire
[OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten) along with many other security flaws found in real-world
applications!
